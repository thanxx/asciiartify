# Project Concept for AsciiArtify: Local Kubernetes Deployment Tools Comparison

## Introduction

AsciiArtify is a startup that aims to develop a new software product for converting images into ASCII art using Machine Learning. Founded by two young programmers with software development experience, AsciiArtify is preparing a project concept and selecting tools for their local development system. They are considering Kubernetes-based options â€” minikube, kind, and k3d. To manage code and collaborate, AsciiArtify has decided to use GitHub for version control to ensure security and process control.

Since AsciiArtify plans to use Kubernetes for deploying and scaling their software product, they evaluated several Kubernetes-based systems for local development. This document presents a comparative analysis of three tools for local Kubernetes cluster deployment: minikube, kind, and k3d, taking into account potential risks with Docker licensing and exploring the possibility of using Podman as an alternative.

## Tools Description and Purpose

### Minikube
Minikube is a local Kubernetes system that allows you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster on a single computer. It is a convenient option for development and testing on a local machine.

### Kind (Kubernetes IN Docker)
Kind is a tool that enables the creation of local Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers. It is considered for local testing purposes.

### K3d
K3d is a tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers using Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE). K3d allows for quick creation and testing of Kubernetes clusters within Docker containers and is chosen by AsciiArtify for preparing the PoC.

## Demonstration

### Recommended Tool: K3d
Below is a brief demonstration of deploying a "Hello World" application using K3d:

1. **Install K3d:**
   ```bash
   curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash



2. **Create Cluster:** 
    ```
    k3d cluster create mycluster

3. **Deploy "Hello World" Application:**
   ```
    kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    kubectl expose deployment hello-world --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

4. **Access the Application:**
   ```
   kubectl get service



## Conclusions

Minikube: Suitable for comprehensive development and testing but has scalability limitations.
Kind: Ideal for lightweight, fast setups, and CI/CD integration, but relies on Docker.
K3d: Offers the best balance for quick cluster creation and development, making it the recommended choice for AsciiArtify's PoC.
Each tool has unique strengths and weaknesses. Based on the practical analysis and testing, K3d is recommended for AsciiArtify's local Kubernetes cluster deployment due to its speed, ease of use, and integration capabilities.
